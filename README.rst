OneTask: Manage task, one task at the time
==========================================

**OneTask** let you focus on one task at the time, avoiding discouragement by seing all the remaining work to do.

QuickStart
----------

- Add a task::

    $> onetask add 'Create onetask'
    Task added

- Get a random task::

    $> onetask get
    Create onetask

If you try to get another task, you will get the same one.

- Mark current task as done::

    $> onetask done
    Task is marked as done

    $> onetask get
    No task
